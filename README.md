Introduction
------------

In the project i have designed a neo pixel led pattern. 

Components Required
------------
1. Arduino Uno
2. WS2812b led strip

Connections
------------
**STEP 1:** Connect the VCC pin of led strip to the +5V pin of Arduino Uno,Connect the GND pin of led strip to the GND pin of Arduino Uno and Connect the data pin of led strip to the digital pin 5 of Arduino Uno.\
**STEP 2:** Upload the **code.ino** file in Arduino Uno.\
**STEP 3:** Enjoy the amazing style of Led Strip.
